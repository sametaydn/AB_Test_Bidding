## Business Problem

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type called "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing "maximum bidding." 

One of our clients, bombabomba.com, has decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A/B test to determine if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding. 

The A/B test has been running for 1 month, and now bombabomba.com is looking to you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success metric for bombabomba.com is "Purchase." 

Therefore, the focus should be on the "Purchase" metric for statistical testing.

## Dataset Story

This dataset contains information about a company's website, including the number of ads seen and clicked by users, as well as the revenue generated from these ads. 

There are two separate datasets for the Control and Test groups, which are provided in separate sheets of the ab_testing.xlsx Excel file. 

The Control group has been subjected to Maximum Bidding, while the Test group has been subjected to Average Bidding.

## Process

* I conducted an A/B test to determine if average bidding generates more conversions than maximum bidding.
